########################### Release version 3.01 ##############################

Last update Tue Jun 15 08:10:40 1999 - Federico Carminati

This is the Version 3.01 of the ALICE simulation and reconstruction
software. This code will be released after the May ALICE Offline
Meeting. It is intended to offer a general purpose framework for ALICE
simulation and reconstruction. The program should not be considered
complete, and we are relying on the feed-back from users to correct bugs
and provide improvements.

The simulation program is based on GEANT3.21. A special version of the
GEANT library and a mini-CERN Library are needed to run this code.

Installation
------------

- Install ROOT and define the ROOTSYS symbol correctly.

- Decide in which directory you will install the ALICE sofware. We will
indicate it with <directory>

- Define the following global variables in the login script

ALICE			= <directory>
ALICE_LEVEL		= pro
ALICE_ROOT		= $ALICE/$ALICE_LEVEL
ALICE_TARGET		= `uname`
LD_LIBRARY_PATH 	= $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\:$ALICE_ROOT/lib (on all systems)
SHLIB_PATH		= $SHLIB_PATH\:$ALICE_ROOT/lib (on hpux)
PATH			= $PATH\:$ALICE_ROOT/bin

At this point you should logout, login again and check that the symbols are
set correctly

EITHER
======

- Get the file /afs/cern.ch/alice/offline/dist/AliOffline3.01.tar.gz

- Unpack it with

$ cd $ALICE
$ gtar xvfz AliOffline3.01.tar.gz

OR
==

- Get the files

      /afs/cern.ch/alice/offline/dist/AliRoot3.01.tar.gz (AliRoot code)
      /afs/cern.ch/alice/offline/dist/AliLibs3.01.tar.gz (minicern code)

THEN PROCEED WITH
=================

- install the CERN library part

$ cd $ALICE_ROOT
$ gmake cernlibs

- Install the ALICE specific software

$ cd $ALICE_ROOT
$ gmake

- Copy the file $ALICE_ROOT/.rootrc to your home directory

- run the code

$ aliroot

root [1] .x menu.C


Notice for Linux users
======================

AliRoot requires the compiler system egcs 1.1.1 or later. Unfortunately the 
location of the include files is dependent on the compiler version on Linux.
While g++ knows the location of the files relative to its own version, but 
this is not the case for the makedepend, that should be told where include
files are. This is accomplished by the DEPINC variable in the file
$ALIROOT/conf.

In case several error message appear during the make phase, complaining for
include files not found, the list of include directories in DEPINC should
be compared with the standard list of the compiler, that can be found out
with the following commands:

touch dummy.cxx
g++ -v dummy.cxx

and looking at the output between the lines:

#include <...> search starts here:

End of search list.

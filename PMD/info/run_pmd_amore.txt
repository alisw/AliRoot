Code Structures
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

PMD Amore runs Using ALICE offline QA in
aliroot. The main codes are 

AliPMDQAChecker.cxx     
AliPMDQADataMakerRec.cxx 
AliPMDQADataMakerSim.cxx

and we have following objects in the QA 
(Related to Data only)

Frequency Distributions for each DDL

hDdl2304
hDdl2305
hDdl2308
hDdl2309

XY - Display for each Plan
hPreXY
hCpvXY

Multiplicity Plots:
hPmdMultiplicityP
hPmdMultiplicityC

Quality Plots:

hPmdQualityWAdc: The wighted ADC over two DDLs in a same plane ( divided in 20 eta rings - 10 each plane) 
hPmdQualityHit : The total hits over two DDLs in a same plane ( divided in 20 eta rings - 10 each plane)

Now Amore is working on aldaqacr58 pc (PMD ACR PC). 
It could be run by simply typing

amore -d EVE -m GenericGui

Detailed step to start the gui :

1. On ACR machine type :

   amore -d EVE -m GenericGui

it will pop up with amore screen.

2. PMD agent is now visible in the tree and locate the objects

3. Optionally, to see only PMD agent in the tree, type PMD in the filter field

4. Select EDep of corresponding SMs or XY histos by double clicking corresponding name from amore tree.

In this no way to flush the memory being processed by central QA server.

NOTE: Default it will pick data from amoreAgentPMDShifter. Which is link to DQM QA 
checkers. But instantaneously we can launch our own agent. it will not crash with 
earlier one. if so do following before lunching GUI.

To start the agent :
1. connect to DQM server
2. Type :amoreAgent -a amoreAgentPMDQA

Then follow the above steps GUI.

During Operation at P@2

For the Central Shifter following two plots should be
ok to judge PMD quality

hPmdQualityWAdc: The wighted ADC over two DDLs in a same plane ( divided in 20 eta rings - 10 each plane) 
hPmdQualityHit : The total hits over two DDLs in a same plane ( divided in 20 eta rings - 10 each plane)

The ratio (hit and adc weighted hit) of two ddls in same plane. 
=> this produces four combinations, but for simplicity it merged to two histograms 
=> zones are leveled in the plot itself.
=> The marker should stay between 1 to 4 in y-axis. Because of asymmetric hits these 
   value might oscillate very fast, however if these value stay at 1 for a long time 
   ( 10 minutes - then on-call should be called ) => Briefly this if it stay at 1 
    for long time then DDLs are sending blank data.

=> PMD HI: Expected 150Kb/evt if more pedestal run is required. PMD PP: 
        Event Size 8 Kbs/event Can go upto 15Kbs if more pedestal run is required.

=> During cosmic runs and technical runs we mostly collect noise so these references 
may not be of good quality.

=> Please wait until at least three cycle to declare PMD quality as bad.

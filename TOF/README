    README file for ALICE Time Of Flight Detector Oflfine Code
    ==========================================================

Intorduction
------------

This is a short overview of the TOF code within the AliROOT framework.


Structure
---------

There are 3 libraries build for the TOF. These are 

* libTOFbase:
  This contains the basic stuff, like data classes and managers. 

* libTOFsim: 
  This contains code used by the simulation only. This includes the
  detector class, AliTOF, and its derivatives. It also contains the
  code for building the geometry, as well as the (s)digitisers, raw
  data writer, QA checker and data containers.

* libTOFrec:
  Code needed for the reconstruction. This includes the reconstruction
  code itself, as well as cluster and track containers and QA checker.

The content of these libraries is detailed more below. 

libTOFbase:
-----------

Till today (February 6th 2008), it contains the following classes

  AliTOFGeometry:
	Manager of TOF geometry data. All code queries this manager
	for geometry parameters, so that the data are always consistent. 
  
  AliTOFdigit
  AliTOFrawData
  AliTOFHitData
  AliTOFHitDataBuffer
	Base classes for digits and real digits. They are all data
        classes that hold the TOT and TOF values for a single sensitive
        TOF element.

  AliTOFChannelOffline
  AliTOFChannelOnline
  AliTOFChannelOnlineStatus
  AliTOFcalib
  AliTOFDataDCS
  AliTOFFormatDCS:
	Calibration data classes.

  AliTOFRawMap:
	A map of (AliTOFrawData) indices.
        The AliTOFRawStream class uses this map to store raw data
        before making digits or clusters.

  AliTOFDecoder
  AliTOFRawStream:
	Classes to read raw data files.

  AliTOFAlignment:

  AliTOFPreprocessor
  AliTOFPreprocessorFDR:

libTOFsim:
----------

Till today (February 6th 2008), it contains the following classes

  AliTOF:
	Manager for all TOF simulation code.

  AliTOFv5T0
  AliTOFv6T0:
	Simulation drivers for the TOF detector.
	AliTOFv5T0 corresponds to a simulation where services are not
        completly described
        AliTOFv6T0 contains a more detailed description of all TOF
        detector components.

  AliTOFhit
  AliTOFhitT0:
	Base classes for hits. They hold the geometrical and physical
        informations of a single sensitive TOF element, like the ALICE
        coordinates, the detector indices, i.e. 5 integer numbers
        (sector, module, strip, par-row and pad numbers), the hit
        coordinates in the pad reference system and the
        time-of-flight measurement. Moreover, they hold also some
        additional measurements, like the momentum components, the
        energy loss in the sensitive TOF element and the track incident
        angle on the pad. Only the AliTOFhitT0 object contains also
        the track length measurement.

  AliTOFSDigit:
	Base classes for sdigits. They hold the TOF detector informations,
        like the detector indices, i.e. 5 integer numbers
        (sector, module, strip, par-row and pad numbers), the
        time-of-flight and the time-over-threshold informations
        according to the test beam results.
	Each detector element can record more than one sdigit (but
        not more than 3).

  AliTOFSDigitizer
  AliTOFDigitizer:
	Base class for the (s)digitiser. AliTOFSDigitizer makes
	summable digits (AliTOFSDigit) from hits, and AliTOFDigitizer
        makes digits (quasi real data) from summable digits.

  AliTOFHitMap
	A map of (AliTOFSDigit) indices.
        The AliTOFSDigitizer uses this map to store simulation data
        (i.e. hits) before making sdigits.

  AliTOFDigitMap:
	A map of (AliTOFdigit) indices.
        The AliDDLRawData uses this map to store the TOF digits indices
        before making real digits (i.e. raw data).

  AliTOFDDLRawData:
	Base class for digit-to-raw_data transformation.
        It makes raw data from digits: practically, it transforms the
        5 detector indices (sector, module, strip, pad-row and pad numbers)
	in hardware address, consisting of 5 induces (TOF readout
        module, slot, chain, TDC and channel numbers).

libTOFrec:
----------

Till today (February 6th 2008), it contains the following classes

	Reconstructed point in the TOF. These objects are made
	AliTOFReconstructor. 

  AliTOFClusterFinder:

  AliTOFtrack:
	Base classe for TOF tracks. It holds ...

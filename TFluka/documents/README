Instructions on how to use TFLuka

1) External packages needed:

  * Download Fluka from http://pcfluka.mi.infn.it/ and install it

  * Download geant4_vmc and install it (together with Geant4, CLHEP, etc)
    NOTE: All the geant4_vmc headers are assumed to be in 
    $ALICE/geant4_vmc/include. To put them there:
    - Go to $ALICE/geant4_vmc
      [host] cd $ALICE/geant4_vmc
    - Make the include directory
      [host] mkdir include
    - Put links to the headers:
      [host] cd include
      [host] find $ALICE/geant4_vmc -name "*.h" -exec ln -s {} . \;

2) Set the your environment:

  * Set the path to Fluka in the environment variable FLUPRO

  * Set your geant4 environment in the usual way.

  * Make sure that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes the path to CLHEP, GEANT4 
    and geant4_vmc libraries

3) Compile TFluka and Flugg. In AliRoot do: 

  * gmake all-TFluka

  * gmake all-Flugg

4) Run aliroot with FLUKA:

  * Execute the $ALICE_ROOT/TFluka/scripts/runalifluka.csh

  * [root] .x $ALICE_ROOT/TFluka/macro/loadlibs.C

  * [root] gAlice->RunMC();


This will run 50 particles from TGenerator.

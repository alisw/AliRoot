 PWG3 module for Heavy Flavour Physics Analysis

----------------------------------------------------------

Our code has been split in 4 libraries: 
PWG3base, PWG3vertexingHF, PWG3muon and PWG3vertexingOld.

It is planned that PWG3vertexingOld will be removed in near future. 
There is a dependence on AliRun class.

For the moment there is not any dependence between the libraries, 
but it is allowed a dependence muon and vertexingHF from the base library.

You can compile the libraries via the command make all-PWG3
 in the ALICE_ROOT directory

The par files related to each library can be created via the command 
make PWG3library.par
You can check the par file compilation in a root session in the following way:
root [0] .L $ALICE_ROOT/PWG3/muon/RunAnalysis.C
root [1] setupPar("PWG3library")                 

In order to load muon and vertexingHF  libraries in a root session  
you will need, first, to load the following Root and AliRoot libraries :
gSystem->Load("libTree")
gSystem->Load("libGeom")
gSystem->Load("libVMC")
gSystem->Load("libANALYSIS")
gSystem->Load("libSTEERbase")
gSystem->Load("libESD")     
gSystem->Load("libAOD")
gSystem->Load("libANALYSISalice")

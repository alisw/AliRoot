Making a new module/library

Automatic ROOT dictionary generation:
The automatic ROOT dictionary generation relies on the rule, that the main class
of a header file has the same name as the file (except the prefix).

Troubleshooting:

most likely there is no class <class name> defined in the header file <class name>.h*

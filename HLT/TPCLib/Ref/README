This directory contains HLT TPC analysis code components based on
a version of the code from Anders Vestbo before the HLT code was
checked in to AliRoot. The reason the code exists is because the
tracker from this module finds significantly (approx. factor of 
two) more tracks than the one from the module one directory up.
This code is not intended to be developed any further, but exists
just as a reference for the new version.

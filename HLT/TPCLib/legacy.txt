Some files have been kept for the sake of legacy and are now 
removed from the repository:
- AliHLTTPCClustFinderNew.h/.cxx removed 20.09.2007
  was the active cluster finder when the TPC HLT code was migrated to the new
  component interface and project scheme. Unfortunately it got the name "New"
  when it was developed. The present AliHLTTPCClusterFinder originates from it.
- AliHLTTPC.cxx/.h  removed 20.09.2007
  old steering class of TPC reconstruction
- AliHLTTPCRawDataFormat.h removed 20.09.2007
  the structure has been added to AliHLTTPCDigitData.h

# For any features that need or you want to be implemented, add them to this  #
# file. For each such item give it a new sequential number and write the      #
# time/date stamp next to that. This can be the output of the date command    #

# implemented and if possible, how to go about doing that.                    #
# Any features that get implemented can then be removed from this wish list.  #
# If something is partially implemented then update the status in this file.  #
# If a item is referenced by an as yet unimplemented item then rather than    #
# removing that item, leave it and just add the IMPLEMENTED tag to the item.  #

1) Wed Nov 24 21:30:19 SAST 2004

Integrate cluster finder with the dHLT by taking the Indian code and wrapping
that into the CenterOfGravityFinder template.
This might require rearranging large parts of the Indian code or even rewrites.
--> BB adds Wed Nov 24 23:01  
	I am working on validating the Indian code. I suggest :
	i) 	breaking up single macro into a set of functions, which will make it 
	   	easier to write into a class for aliroot. 
	ii) 	macros to easily generate raw data from aliroot events  
	    	and standardised Simulation macro to generate reference event.  
--> BB adds Friday Nov 24 23:44
	Added examples directory, where there is a raw data generation example. 
	Currently, all LUT for raw data generation are in the examples dir.
	These will be moved to DDL, while hit reconstruction will be implemented in
	Clustering, soon to be renamed to "HitReconstruction". This will implement a
	clean version of the Calcutta software hit reconstruction from raw data. 
	
===============================================================================

2) Wed Nov 24 21:30:19 SAST 2004

Create the following pipe I/O components:
	L2 accept signal simulator - Most of the network level code is complete.
	triggerDDL - almost done.
	chamberDDL - Simulating DDL output from the tracking chambers.
	trigger DDL to TriggerRecord translator.
	dummy TriggerRecord publisher.
	CenterOfGravityFinder - refer to item (1).
	dummy ClusterPoint block publisher.
	MansoTracker component - The MansoTracker algorithm is implemented but
		everything has not yet been intergrated into a component.
	dummy Track publisher.
	Decision component
	dummy Decision publisher.
	DDL output data packer for Track data.
	DDL output data packer for Decision data.
	analysis tools.
	debug tools. (utilities to dump an analyze data/signals etc as it passes
		through the system)
	timing tools. (Not that trivial).

===============================================================================

3) Wed Nov 24 21:30:19 SAST 2004

Create Pub/Sub components similar to those described in item (2).
Will need to see what code can be used in both component types. Hopefully most.

===============================================================================

4) Wed Nov 24 21:30:19 SAST 2004

Intergrate with AliRoot. Exactly what this means is yet to be defined, but for
now the obvious components required are:
	GUI interface - a lot to be done here. Ideally one should be able to
		monitor and control everything from some kind of GUI. Perhaps
		some form of HTTP/HTML application/front end would be usefull.
	dHLTInterface - API through which AliRoot talks to dHLT proper.
	Driver components - Here I am talking about things like MicrodHLT. It
		does all the dirty work behind the scenes to talk to dHLT code.
		We will require one for a more full blow dHLT using a memory
		resident framework (here I am thinking about Framework/Global).
		Also one that talks to the different external implementation
		of dHLT running on Pub/Sub etc...

===============================================================================

5) Wed Nov 24 21:30:19 SAST 2004

Prepare tools to manage and manipulate the mappings for the chambers and trigger.
That is: create, transform, upload, download (to the running components) etc..
the LUTs.

===============================================================================

6) Wed Nov 24 21:30:19 SAST 2004

Add a packet delivered event to the BCMP::Sender class so that we can tell if
our messages get delivered or not.

===============================================================================

7) Fri Nov 26 23:49:41 SAST 2004

Rename Clustering namespace and subdir to HitReconstruction. Refer to item (1).

===============================================================================

8) Fri Nov 26 23:49:41 SAST 2004

Add functionality to print DDL raw data fromats (ADC and L0) to screen.
i.e. extend the printrawdata program.

===============================================================================

9) Fri Nov 26 23:49:41 SAST 2004

Implement all functionality behind cammand line switched added to the
signalL2 program. (requires random number generator, might give option to build
against ROOT's random number generator).

===============================================================================

10) Sun Nov 28 16:15:33 SAST 2004

Perform better error checking on the triggernumber parameter of GetTrigger
method for TriggerSource class. It currently SegFaults if this parameter
is not correct.

===============================================================================

11) Sun Nov 28 22:25:54 SAST 2004

Add functionality to make macros and scripts directory be added to distribution
archive. Also have symbolic links created for scripts into the bin directory.
For the distribution the scripts can be copied into the bin directory.

===============================================================================

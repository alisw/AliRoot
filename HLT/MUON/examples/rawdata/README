RAW DATA EXAMPLE 
Bruce Becker | brucellino@gmail.com

This is the directory with macros to generate digitised data with AliRoot 
and generate binary raw data streams with the Indian code. The raw data is reconstricuted 

The macros are :
1) Config_MUON_test.C 
	This is the basic config script with the simulation and generation 
	parameters.
2) Simulation.C
	to simulate 1 muon in the spectrometer acceptance (with 
	Config_MUON_test.C) , and simulate the digitised data. After running 
	Simulation.C you will have MUON.Digits.root
3) rawddl4.C and rawdl5.C
	These macros generate the raw data DDL-wise for the stations 4 and 5 
	respectively. The raw data reads look-up tables for each DDL (13-20) 
	and produces the hit files DDL-wise. These are ddl<DDLn>.dat. This is 
	unformatted binary data.
4) dhlt_v2.C 
	This macro reads the DDL of choice and generates reconstructed hit 
	positions from the binary data. The files produced are separated into 
	bending and non-bending planes - hit(n|b)<DDLn>.dat.

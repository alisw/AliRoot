dHLT - Dimuon High level Trigger
================================

This module is the implementation of the High Level Trigger for the muon
spectrometer. Please refer to the top level HLT directory or AliRoot for build
instructions.

Directories:
============

HLT/MUON
	Contains common source code and files.

HLT/MUON/OfflineInterface
	All online analysis components and algorithm codes are found here.

HLT/MUON/OnlineAnalysis
	Components used specifically to interface with AliRoot are placed in
	this directory.

HLT/MUON/utils/
	Contains ROOT and AliRoot macros, and various utility and debugging
	programs specifically for the dHLT.

HLT/MUON/doc/
	Contains specification and design documentation.
	
HLT/MUON/examples/ 
	Contains tutorials and various examples of how to use the dHLT.


Files:
===================

README
	This file. Should add any general or important information to help get
	people started with working with this module.

TODO
	This is a list describing things that need to be done. It can also
	contain a wish list, i.e. things that would be nice to implement in the

================================
dHLT - Dimuon High level Trigger
================================

This module is the implementation of the dHLT algorithm.


Building:
=========

1) To build the dHLT modules type the following command in the shell in the top
directory of the dHLT project:

> make


2) To generate a distribution tar.gz file:

> make dist

The distribution archive will be found in the same directory as this readme file.


3) To generate a distribution for debugging:

> make debug-dist


4) To compile all objects in debug mode for debugging with gdb for example:

> make debug


5) To run build process in verbose mode:

> make verbose


6) To generate source code documentation using doxygen:

> make doc


7) To remove all intermediate files generated during the build process (excluding
binaries and libraries):

> make clean


8) To remove all files generated during the build process (including output 
binaries and libraries):

> make clean-all



Directories:
============

src/ 
	Contains all source code.

examples/ 
	Contains scripts for running certain example uses of the dHLT
	

macros/
	Contains ROOT and AliRoot macros used to run parts of the software.
        Can contain other scripts also.


build/
	Contains all files (such as make files) required to build the binaries and libraries.	 


doc/
	Contains any specification or design documentation.
	(BB 26/11/04) Also contains a dHLTconfig file for generating doxygen
	documentation easily.

Generated Directories:
======================

bin/
	Contains binary executables.


lib/
	Contains libraries (shared objects / DLL's).


include/
	Contains include C++ header files required to compile against the libraries in lib/

srcdoc/
	Documentation generated from the source code using doxygen is placed into this
	directory.

output/
	All temporary files that get generated during the build process such as .d and .o files
	are written to this directory. The directory contains a subdirectory for every module
	built containing that modules specific files.


      Files:
===================

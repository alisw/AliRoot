Installation
============
Package build relies on the GNU triplet configure, make and make install.
It is suggested to use a separate build directory, e.g. from the
top directory do

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../configure
  make
  make install

The default install directories are set to the current directory ($PWD). Try

To override the default prefix use
--prefix=<dir>           

Some important options:
--enable-logging  # Enable/Disable logging (default enabled)
--enable-sample   # Compile the sample library
--enable-tpc      # Compile the TPC library

If you need further information on the GNU build system, execute from the 
top directory:
./configure --help | less

----------
Quickstart
-----------
Without thinking, you can do the follwoing to create a tree with calibration entries.
The default settings should work, however you might want to change them for 'better' performance.

Do the following:
1. Setup environment
   a. gui dependend variables

export SCRIPTDIR=$ALICE_ROOT/TPC/scripts
export PATH=$SCRIPTDIR:$PATH

   b. Alien

alien-token-init
source /tmp/gclient_env_${UID}
or 
$ALICE_ROOT/TPC/CalibMacros/alienSetupGSI.sh (GSI specific)

2. Run tree creation
   a. Run on a list of run numbers with name 'list.txt', one run number per line

makeCalibTree -l list.txt

   b. Run on a range of run numbers:

makeCalibTree -r 75000-80000


myrun=70000
endrun=90000
bdir=`pwd`
while [ $myrun -le ${endrun} ]  ; do
       mydir=$GUI_OUTDIR/tmp/$myrun;
       mkdirhier $mydir
       cd $mydir;
       $BATCHCOMMAND -oo $GUI_OUTDIR/logs/log$myrun.log -eo $GUI_OUTDIR/logs/err$myrun.out  makeCalibTree  -o   -r $myrun-$(($myrun+500));
       myrun=$(( $myrun +500 )) ;
       echo $myrun; 
done;
cd $bdir

   c. Run automatic tree creation for all runs in the
      data taking period which was set up (see below)
      !!!WARNING!!! this will take quite some time

makeCalibTree -a

3. Start the GUI browser

guiTime


-------------------
General information
-------------------
The macros and shell scripts used are stored in $ALICE_ROOT/TPC/CalibMacros/guiTime
If you would like to modify some setting (see below), but do not have write access to this
directory, you can copy the complete directory somewhere else and setup the environment
variables accordingly:

export SCRIPTDIR=path_to_my_directory
export PATH=$SCRIPTDIR:$PATH

- setup scripts
All user relevant setup is done the shell script 'guiEnv' and the root macro 'ConfigOCDB.C'
All other files don't need to be modified by the user.

- scripts for the tree creation:
makeCalibTree:        Steering script to launch the tree creation
makeCalibTreeList:    script running the actual root process to create the tree

- scripts to start the gui:
gui 'filename':       Start the CalibViewerGUI using the tree in file 'filename'. Invokes the script
                      startGUI.C
guiTime ['filename']: Start the CalibViewerGUItime. Optionally a filename containing the calibration
                      calibration tree can be specified. Otherwise the trees from the directory setup
                      in guiEnv will be used (see below). Invokes the script startGUItime.C

-oter scripts:
loadlibsREC.C:        Root macro to load only libraries needed to start the gui and tree creation.


----------------
Customised setup
----------------

- Defining the OCDB directories (ConfigOCDB.C):
Before starting the tree creation or gui the macro 'ConfigOCDB.C' is exectued. This macro should contain
all the setup needed to point to the proper OCDB directories. If alien is used, alien needs also to be
setup in the macro. Open the macro for examples.

- General output information (guiEnv):
In the 'guiEnv' script environment variables defining default output directories etc. See comments in the
file for explanations.

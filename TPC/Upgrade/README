Continuous readout toy simulation

loadlibs.C    //modified version of the one used for GEMtest code. I haven't looked into this so it probably contains a lot of stuff that is not needed

ToyMCTrack, ToyMCEvent //classes for storing event and track parameters

ToyMCEventGenerator   //base class for event generators, contains DistortTrack method to distort track using method borrowed from AliTPCCorrection

ToyMCEventGeneratorSimple  //simple first MC event generator, borrowing from Marians macro. Inherits from ToyMCEventGenerator to get DistortTrack method. Generate(Double_t time) generates and returns an event at time time

makeTree.C  //short macro to generate events from a poisson distr and storing in a ROOT tree.


to run : root -l loadlibs.C
       	 .L makeTree.C+
	 makeTree(Double_t collFreq/*kHz*/, Double_t bunchFreq/*MHz*/, Int_t nEvents)

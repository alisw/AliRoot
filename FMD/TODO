	Things to do in the FMD offline code
	------------------------------------



* Split geometry
   Split rings/cone into half rings/cones for alignment. All most
   done.   
- Need a bit of checking.
- Perhaps we need to introduce detector volumes again to make sure
   that the volume iterators find the right volume.

* Transformations 
   In AliFMDGeometry, get the global transformation matrices
   for each sensitive volume (use TGeoIterator).   
- Almost done.  
- Need to use it in the code.

* Alignment
   Try implement alignment objects. 
- Make a script that makes `dummy' alignments in a file. 
- Read in the alignments, and apply them in simulation and
   reconstruction. 

* Calibration 
   Get calibration parameters (in AliFMDParameters) from CDB.
- Make a script that makes dummy calibrations. 
- Read in dummy calibrations, and use them

* Translations
-  Implement Detector2XYZ via TGeoMatrix. 
-  Implement XYZ2Detector via TGeoMatrix.

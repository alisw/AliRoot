21-apr-2005 NvE First release of the package as a subdirectory of Ralice/icepack.
29-apr-2005 NvE Library creation scripts for Linux gcc etc... introduced.
                Argument 'float' changed to 'double' for function isnan in amanda.c
                to match gcc definition and setting of unused variable 'pi' removed
                from IceF2k.cxx.
17-jun-2005 NvE Class IceF2k modified to provide a task-based processing environment.
                For this IceF2k has been derived from the new RALICE class AliJob.
                The example macro icef2k.cc has been updated accordingly.
21-jun-2005 NvE Install scripts for gcc corrected to also include the rdmc stuff
                in the produced shared libs.
23-jun-2005 NvE Specification of output file and consequently writing-out of the
                produced datastructures made optionally in IceF2k.
                This will allow IceF2k to be used as a facility to investigate/analyse
                F2K data using the Ralice/IcePack analysis tools without producing output
                data files.
24-jun-2005 NvE In the IceF2k docs and the icef2k.cc example macro the output file is
                not explicitly closed to allow interactive investigation of the output
                data tree when the macro is run in an interactive ROOT/CINT session.
20-jul-2005 NvE RDMC index "off by one" problem fixed in IceF2k.cxx when setting the
                bin contents for a waveform histogram.
05-aug-2005 NvE Support for printfreq=0 introduced in IceF2k to allow suppression of
                the event summary printout.
08-aug-2005 NvE (De)calibration functions introduced in IceF2k::FillOMdbase and IceF2k::PutHits
                to enable access to either automatically calibrated or de-calibrated data.
11-aug-2005 NvE New class IceCal2Root introduced to convert Amacalib ascii data into
                Ralice/IcePack structures.
20-sep-2005 NvE Dummy values 0 set for KAPPA-ADC and KAPPA-TOT for OMs in IceCal2Root
                to stay in line with the F2K data structures.
                Also ADC dependent LE (de)calibration parameter set to 1e20 in IceF2k
                for adc<=0 values. This setting eliminates the ADC dependent TDC correction.
12-oct-2005 NvE CleanTasks() invoked before execution of sub-tasks in IceConvert and IceCal2Root
                to ensure proper execution of all the sub-tasks for each new event.
31-oct-2005 NvE Some unused variables removed in IceCal2Root and IceF2k to prevent warnings
                from the gcc compiler.

31-oct-2005 NvE Slight correction in IceCalibrate.cxx and IceCleanhits.cxx to satisfy
                the gcc compiler (thanks Dipo).
                Also first (prototype) version of class IceDwalk introduced to perform
                direct walk reconstruction. In the /macros directory an example job
                icedwalk.cc has been introduced.
03-nov-2005 NvE User selectable trigger time setting introduced in IceCleanhits to allow
                investigation of various trigger time settings.
                Protection introduced in IceDwalk for the case that no track candidates
                are left.
                Also protection introduced in IceXtalk for the case that no OM database

                the original F2K file didn't contain these data.
                Also anaroot.cc example macro introduced in /macros sub-directory.
                This example macro shows how to analyse the IcePack event structures
                from a chain of ROOT files using the task processor facilities.
28-feb-2006 NvE Example macro anaroot.cc in sub-directory /macros updated to use the

10-mar-2006 NvE Xtalk ADC correction value stored as ADC offset in IceXtalk processing.
                This will allow easy investigation of Xtalk corrected hits and also
                enable successive Xtalk processing to investigate (systematic) effects
                of various criteria. See the IceXtalk docs for further details.

                Also new memberfunction SetPenalty() introduced in IcePandel.

                Also IcePandel updated to use a Convoluted Pandel pdf.
14-sep-2006 NvE IceCalibrate.cxx updated to correctly process multiple waveforms and hits per OM.
                Also some calibration constants dropped from OM data words in IceCalibrate,
                since these values are also stored as parameters in the corresponding
                (de)calibration functions.                 
22-sep-2006 NvE IceDwalk extended for specification of maximum number of hits per OM,
                to allow comparison with Sieglinde (which only uses the first OM hit).
                Also IceDwalk now introduces a device into the event named "IceDwalk"
                which contains the values of all the used reconstruction parameters.
25-oct-2006 NvE Spread of Psi median included in track fit statistics of IceChi2
                and IcePandel.
                Processing parameters of IceCalibrate, IceXtalk, IceCleanHits, IceChi2
                and IcePandel included as the corresponding devices in the event structure. 
15-nov-2006 NvE Separate treatment of v_phase and v_group introduced in IceDwalk, IceChi2
                and IcePandel to improve time residuals (thanks to George Japaridze).
                Also IceLinefit extended for specification of maximum number of hits per OM
                and automatic introduction of a device into the event named "IceLinefit"
                which contains the values of all the used reconstruction parameters and
                the beta value (v/c) of the reconstructed track.
16-nov-2006 NvE Class IceDwalk renamed to IceDwalkx to provide a Sieglinde-like direct
                walk-II approach. The remaining class IceDwalk will provide a more
                sophisticated approach with more physics driven selection criteria.
23-nov-2006 NvE Improved version of IceDwalk installed. Note that the old algorithm is
                still available as IceDwalkx.

                obsolete due to bug fix in IceRawTWR.
28-mar-2007 NvE Explicitly included TMath.h in IceChi2.h and IcePandel.h due to a
                ROOT restructuring introduced in version 5.15/04.
01-jun-2007 NvE Memberfunction GetString() introduced in class IceGOM.
                IceCalibrate.cxx and IceXtalk.cxx updated to support both the old (MuDaq only)
                and new (MuDaq, TWRDaq, ...) calibration file format.
                Also isolation cut in IceCleanHits modified to ignore hits from
                the same OM.
05-jun-2007 NvE Search for attached dbase performed only once in the Exec() memberfunction
                of IceCalibrate and IceXtalk to speed up processing.
06-jun-2007 NvE Explicit tests on null pointers for returned TObjArray* from e.g. GetHits()
                introduced in the .cxx files of IceCalibrate, IceChi2, IceCleanHits, IceDwalk,
                IceDwalkx, IceLinefit, IceMakeHits, IcePandel and IceXtalk to prevent
                problems with empty events.

26-jun-2007 NvE Class IceDwalk made modular such that it can serve as a base class
                for more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms.
                Also expression for "ksi" corrected to correctly represent the traveled
                distance of the cherenkov photon in IcePandel.cxx.
27-sep-2007 NvE Check for event selection/rejection flag introduced in IceCalibrate.cxx,
                IceChi2.cxx, IceCleanHits.cxx, IceDwalk.cxx, IceDwalkx.cxx, IceLinefit.cxx,
                IceMakeHits.cxx, IcePandel.cxx and IceXtalk.cxx.

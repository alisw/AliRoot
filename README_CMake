Steps to Build AliRoot with CMake :

1. Define environment variable ALICE_INSTALL
	export ALICE_INSTALL=$ALICE/AliRootInstall

2. Set Path to point to binaries and libraries that will be built in ALICE_INSTALL
	export PATH=$PATH:$ALICE_INSTALL/bin/tgt_${ALICE_TARGET}
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ALICE_INSTALL/lib/tgt_${ALICE_TARGET}

3. Execute the following commands to build AliRoot
	cd $ALICE_INSTALL
	cmake <path_to_source> 
	make

4. In order to build addtional targets like TFluka, THydjet and SHUTTLE add the following options to the cmake command
	cmake -DTFLUKA=ON -DTHYDJET=ON -DSHUTTLE=ON <path_to_source>

!IMPORTANT! : Make sure you delete all the files in your ALICE_INSTALL directory before you generate the Makefile again to clear the CMakeCache or the generated build system may not function properly.

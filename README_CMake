Note: The CMake build of AliRoot builds out-of-source

Steps to Build AliRoot with CMake :

1. Check out Aliroot source into any folder
	
	svn co http://alisoft.cern.ch/AliRoot/trunk ~/trunk

2. Create a new folder and set the environment variable ALICE_ROOT to point to it
	
	mkdir AliRoot
	cd AliRoot
	export ALICE_ROOT=`pwd`

3. Execute the following commands to build AliRoot

	cmake ~/trunk
	make

4. In order to build addtional targets like THydjet and SHUTTLE add the following options to the cmake command

	cmake -DTHydjet=ON -DSHUTTLE=ON <path_to_source>


!IMPORTANT! - Make sure your source folder is clean. If you used the old make system to build aliroot run make clean in the source directory before you run cmake

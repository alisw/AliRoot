How to open session:
	use static methode  AliRunLoader::Open("galice.root","AlicE","update")
How to retrive pointer to alice run loader:
        use pRICH->GetLoader()->GetRunLoader() (all detector classes inherit from AliDetector wich has GetLoader())
	use methode AliRun::GetRunLoader for gAlice (depricated)
How to get pointers to different root trees:
	TreeE belongs to AliRunLoader, available after AliRunLoader::LoadHeader()
	TreeK belongs to AliRunLoader, available after AliRunLoader::LoadKinematics()
	TreeH belongs to AliLoader   , available after AliLoader::LoadHits()
	TreeS belongs to AliLoader   , available after AliLoader::LoadSDigits()
	TreeD belongs to AliLoader   , available after AliLoader::LoadDigits()
	TreeR belongs to AliLoader   , available after AliLoader::LoadRecPoints()
        all methodes return 0 on success. 
How to deal with the stack of particles?
        - first of all, the stack includes primary as well as secondary particles
	- pointer to the stack is taken:
         	AliRun::Stack() (global gAlice of type AliRun - depricated way to do)
          	AliRunLoader::Stack() but before one needs to load event header by AliRunLoader::LoadHeader() otherwise both methods return 0.
          	Moreover loading header gives the information about number of particles only. 
          	To retrive the list of particle one also needs to load kinematics by AliRunLoader::LoadKinematics()        
	- total amount of particles in stack for a given event:        
         	AliStack::GetNtrack() 
                AliRun::GetEvent() (after LoadHeader())
	- total amount of primary particles in stack for a given event (after LoadHeader()): 
        	AliStack::GetNprimary() 
How to retrive hits:
  -Hits are stored on primary by primary basis. Hits for the given primary is TClonesArray.
   To retrieve all hits one needs to do:
     -initialise the root tree and containers:    AliLoader::LoadHits() 
     -read number of entries in TreeH:           TreeH()->GetEntries()
     -loop on the list of entires:
How to retrive sdigits? 
	Sdigits stored in tree S with the branch of TClonesArray, all sdigits in a single TClonesArray
	So the tree has only one entry.
	One needs to say:
	pRich->GetLoader()->LoadSDigits(); this one open file, get the tree and invoke AliRICH::SetTreeAddress()    
What are the debug methodes avail:
	AliModule::GetDebug() now depricated, use AliDebug printout instead
	AliModule::SetDebug()
	AliRun::GetDebug()
	AliRun::SetDebug()
How to get info for a given particle number:
	Header and Kinematics trees must be loaded, then possible to retrive pointer to Stack of particles
	Int_t AliRunLoader::LoadHeader(); Int_t AliRunLoader::LoadKinematics()
	AliStack *AliRunLoader::Stack()
	TParticle *AliStack::Particle(tid)
	TParticle::Print()
How to deal with AliRunDigitizer:
	AliRunDigitizer::Exec() just call AliRunDigitizer::Digitize()	
How to avoid using gAlice:
	Rich()->GetLoader()->GetRunLoader()->GetAliRun() returns gAlice global pointer.
What are hte meanings of different VMC flags:         
	gMC->IsTrackAlive()
	gMC->IsTrackStop()
	gMC->IsTrackDisappeared()
How is sdigit prodiced from hit:
	Responsible methode is AliRICH::
	One hit may affect one or more pads.
        Hit position is taken on the anod wires plane as the most of avalanche is developed there.
        This poistion is not directly avalable, track intersections with entrance and exit of amplification gap are only store.
        So the position in the middle of the gap is calculated as average out of In and Out position.
        Then, total charge collected for this hit is calculated by AliRICHParam::Hit2Qdc.        
How to get pad number for a local position:
	use static TVector AliRICHParam::Loc2Pad(TVector2 position)
Why list of chambers belongs to AliRICHParam:

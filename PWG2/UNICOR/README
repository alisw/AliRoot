The UNICOR package performs a universal two-particle analysis. The 
two-particle analysis classes like AliDAnalCorrel or AliDAnalPtfluc 
are complemented by standard event variable and single particle 
analyses AliDAnalGlobal and AliDAnalSingle. The package is universal 
in the sense that the same analysis runs on data from ALICE, CERES, 
CBM... The files in this directory have been automatically converted 
to the aliroot standard (Ali prefix was added to all class and file 
names) and thus should not be edited. 

Below are two examples of how to run the analysis on ESD events 
(after editing the input data path in run-alone.C and run-on-train.C). 

1) root run-alone.C

A standalone (non-train) analysis of ESD events, including event 
mixing. AliDLoop class is doing the event loop and mixing. 

2) root run-on-train.C

No event mixing is done. 

In both cases an (identical) output file unicor-result.root should 
be produced, containing the (multidimensional) histograms coming out 
of the analysis. 

In the second case in addition a file kuku.root is produced, containing 
the analysis objects. This is a meaningless by-product.

OFFLINE trigger GUI data quality and debugging tool

- read digits and local trigger decision from simulated/real data
- display
- reprocess trigger decision inside AliRoot
- set x/y strips interactively on boards and transfer them to the AliRoot
  TriggerElectronics, execute trigger algorithm and recover the local trigger
  decision

Classes: *TriggerGUI* 

Library: evaluation

Run
---

aliroot
new AliMUONTriggerGUI()

Main window
-----------

"Map of the local boards as seen from the I.P."

the main window is position sensitive (after file initialization) and it is 
possible to open a GUI for a circuit.

By menus:

File
----

Run     - open a file and start with a given event number
          takes the full path <path>/galice.root

Control - navigate in the tree with events

Exit    - exit the main application

Maps
----

Digits map   - graphical map with digits in the four chambers, MT11 ... MT22

Chambers digit maps window
--------------------------

Update - update the map after:
             - loading of another event
             - changing interactively the strip signals in boards GUI

Circuit
-------

Open   - open a board GUI by circuit number

Trigger
-------

Trigger DSET  - (re)run the trigger algorithm

Circuit GUI window
------------------

- visualize x/y strips
- "Set/unset" x (or) y strips
- "Digits" create board digits from the actual configuration created in the GUI
- "Reset" reset modification on strips done interactively

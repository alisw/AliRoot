\chapter*{Introduction}
\section*{Purpose of this document}

This document is intended to both explain who to use the ALICE simulation and
reconstruction code with respect to or using the ITS detector as the
examples. This document is also to explain how to add new code to the ITS
simulation and reconstruction library, and who the existing ITS simulation and
reconstruction code works. All comments from every user is greatly encouraged.

\section*{How to Run AliRoot}

At this point, we will assume that AliRoot has been compiled and all the
necessary environment variables have been defined, including your path. We will
assume you are in an appropriate directory, for example \texttt{/data} or some
such thing.

to start with type, at your shell prompt, aliroot to start the program.

This will initialize ROOT and load all of the ALICE libraries. At this point
you can do anything you can do in ROOT in addition you have access to every
class defined in the ALICE libraries, including the ALICE global variables. One
very useful ALICE global variable is \texttt{gAlice} which is of type
\texttt{AliRun}. Of the many function defined in the class \texttt{AliRun} are
\texttt{Init(const char* setup="Config.C")} and 
\texttt{Run(const char* setup="Config.C")}. \texttt{Run} both executes
\texttt{Init} and starts executing an ALICE detector simulation. Both of these
functions functions load and execute a configuration file. By default this
configuration file is called \texttt{Config.C}. If such a file exists in your
local directory, for example \texttt{/data}, or if there is no such file in
your local directory it will execute the file
\texttt{\$ALICE\_ROOT/macros/Config.C}. Some other configuration file can be
run simplely by entering that file's name as the argument, for example
\texttt{Init("MyConfig.C")} or \texttt{Run("MyConfig.C")} where
\texttt{MyConfig.C} is either in your local directory (\texttt{/data}) or in
\texttt{\$ALICE\_ROOT/macros}. Of course the full path of \texttt{MyConfig.C}
can be used.

Now lets assume you just want to one event using the standard \texttt{Config.C}
file. This is done simply as

At this point a file called \texttt{galice.root} is created in your present
directory. This file contains all of the ``hits'' produced by the simulation,
all of the particle information, all of the detectors that were defined in the
simulation, and a lot of other information.

One nice thing to do now is to run the hit display program so that you can see
the hits you have just produce in the file \texttt{galice.root}. Either from
your present \texttt{aliroot} session, a new \texttt{aliroot} session, or
from a new \texttt{root} session, you can run the standard macro
\texttt{display.C}. Because you should have \texttt{\$ALICE\_ROOT/macros} in
your path, this is easily done as follows.

\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
root [1] .x display.C
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

You should see the following screen appear (Figure~\ref{ITSMan:ch0:display0}).

\begin{figure*}[htbp]

    displayed is a simplified geometry, not that used by the AliRoot
    simulation.}
    \label{ITSMan:ch0:display0}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

Just like from \texttt{root}, to exit from \texttt{aliroot} just type
\texttt{.q} at the prompt.

\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
root [2] .q
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

For a more interactive way of running \texttt{AliRoot}, instead of typing
\texttt{root[0] gAlice->Run()} you can run a very nice macro called
\texttt{menu.C} also located in \texttt{\$ALICE\_ROOT/macros}. Instead of
running a simulation, it create a menu that that will let you either run an
\texttt{AliRoot} simulation or do a number of other nice things. Please note,
that if you want to display any pictures, first they can take a lot of time and
memory, second you have to run \texttt{Init} first so that the detectors you
want to display are defined.


\section*{Controling your Run: The Config.C file}

There are basicly two files that control nearly every aspect of an
\texttt{AliRoot} simulations. The first and most important is the file
\texttt{\$ALICE\_ROOT/macros/Config.C}. This file will be described in more
detail below. The second file \texttt{\$ALICE\_ROOT/data/galice.cuts} sets the
non-default energy cuts for a large numbers of materials. For the ITS, Every
material has energy-loss via delta rays turned on. For each sensitive material
the lowest energy $\gamma$, $e^{\pm}$, bremsstrahlung, and $\delta$-ray have
their lowest energy set to $7.0\times 10^{-5}$ GeV or $70$ KeV. This is done to
assure that low enough energy $\delta$-rays are properly taken into account for
the signals produce in each detector.

The \texttt{Config.C} file\footnotemark determines just about every thing there
is to about how \texttt{AliRoot} will run. Lets take a look at the first part
of this file.

\footnotetext{The name of the file isn't important. It can be specified either
as an argument to \texttt{gAlice->Run(``Another\_Config.C'')} or as an
argument to \texttt{gAlice->Init(``Another\_Config.C'')}. The default file
name is \texttt{Config.C} and is first looked for in your present directory and
if no such file is found then it uses the one in 
\texttt{\$ALICE\_ROOT/macros}. }

\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
0001  void Config()
0002 {
0003 
0004 new AliGeant3("C++ Interface to Geant3");
0005 
0006 //=======================================================================
0007 //  Create the output file
0008 
0009 TFile *rootfile = new TFile("galice.root","recreate");
0010 rootfile->SetCompressionLevel(2);
0011 TGeant3 *geant3 = (TGeant3*)gMC;
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This file is a \texttt{C++} macro/program. The first line gives the routine
name which must be \texttt{Config()}. Line \texttt{0004} Creates the
\texttt{AliRoot} interface class to GEANT 3.12. Line \texttt{0009} creates the
root output file and its pointer \texttt{rootfile}. Line \texttt{0010} sets the
level of compression to be used in writing this file. Level 2 is a lot of
compression, level 0 is no compression\footnote{see \texttt{TFile} in the
\texttt{ROOT} documentation for a full description.}. Line \texttt{0011}
retrieves the basic transport Monte Carlo that was set at line
\texttt{0004}. Since this is GEANT3.21 this pointer is cast as
\texttt{TGeant3}. This will allow us to set and modify the simulation according
to GEANT3.21.

\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
0012 //
0013 // Set External decayer
0014  AliDecayer* decayer = new AliDecayerPythia();
0015  decayer->SetForceDecay(all);
0016  decayer->Init();
0017  gMC->SetExternalDecayer(decayer);
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

In this next section of the file, the default operation of GEANT 3.21 is
modified by replacing the particle decay mechanism with that of Pythia. This
has the advantage of treating all particle decays in the same way but also make
it easier to determine the parent particles from their decayed products. Line
\texttt{0014} creates the Pythia decay routines, \texttt{0015} sets a flag
in Pythia to decay all particles, and \texttt{0016} initiates the Pythia
package. Line \texttt{0017} replaces the default decay routine in the Monte
Carlo (GEANT 3.12 in this case) with that of Pythia. Next we set some flags
that are specific to GEANT 3.21.

In lines \texttt{0021} through \texttt{0042} set different GEANT 3.21 specific
options and flags. I will not describe all of these, but will refer you to the
GEANT 3.21 manual. There are a few of possible interest. Line 
\texttt{0021 geant3->SetTRIG(1);} sets the number of events that will be
processed. The default is one. Line \texttt{0022 geant3->SetSWIT(4,10);} sets
how often a line like 
\texttt{GTREVE\_ROOT : Transporting primary track No 74130} will be
displayed. Here the 10 means every 10 primary tracks. Most of the rest turn on
or off different physics processes. These values apply to every material that
isn't listed in \texttt{\$ALICE\_ROOT/data/galice.cuts} or if that material has
its corresponding flag or value set to -1. Similarly line \texttt{0047} sets
the default lowest energy, largest time of flight, for different physics
processes that are not overwritten by the values in the \texttt{galice.cuts}
file.

\normalsize

In lines \texttt{0053} through \texttt{0059} setup the particle generator to be
used. Line \texttt{0053} defines the type of particle generator to be used. In
this case it will be the ALICE HIJING parameterized particle distribution. 
This can be replace with many others
\footnote{See \texttt{\$ALICE\_ROOT/macros/Config\_gener.C} for more
examples.}. Its parameter value $84210$ is the number of primary tracks that
will be generated. For simple testing this number it typically set to a value
like 50. Lines \texttt{0054} through \texttt{0058} set different parameters for
the generator. Specifically line \texttt{0054 gener->SetMomentumRange(0,999);}
set the limits of the momentum range of the particles that will be
generated. Line \texttt{0055 gener->SetPhiRange(0,360);} sets the angular
(degrees) range in $\phi$ or around the barrel that the partials will be
generated in. In this case the full $\phi$ range will be used. The next line
\texttt{0056 gener->SetThetaRanger(0.28,179.72);} sets the $\theta$ angular
(degrees) range for the primary tracks to be generated in. In this case
$0.28^{\circ}$ to $179.72^{\circ}$ covers the pseudorapidity range $-6.0\leq
\eta \geq +6.0$. With these values of $\theta$ and $\phi$, $84210$ primary
tracks represents about $8000$ primary particles in the central one unit of
pseudorapidity, the maximum track density that ALICE has been designed for.

Line \texttt{0057 gener->SetOrigin(0,0,0);} sets the central position of the
event origin. Line \texttt{0058 gener->SetSigma(0,0,0);} set the
$\sigma_{x,y,z}$ range over which multiple events will have their origins
distributed. The mean position being given by the \texttt{SetOrigin} command
above. It is also possible in one event, to distribute each primary track over
a region who's mean is set by the \texttt{SetOrigin} command and who's width is
set with the \texttt{SetSigma} command. If this is what you want then uncomment
out line \texttt{0064}. Line \texttt{0059 gener->Init();} initializes the
particle generation routine defined by \texttt{0053} with any and all
parameters defined later on. Lastly line \texttt{0066
gAlice->SetField(-999,2);} defines what kind, if any, magnetic field should be
used. These values instruct \texttt{AliRoot} to read a magnetic field map from
\texttt{\$ALICE\_ROOT/data/field02.dat}.

In these following lines \texttt{0068} through \texttt{0086} a series of flags
are defined to make it easy to turn on or off different detectors. There is one
such flag for each detector/major structural element. A value of 1 turns on
that detector and a value of 0 turns it off. For example, Line 
\texttt{0068 Int\_t iMAG=1;} turns on the magnetic field for all of 
ALICE\footnotemark. Line \texttt{0069 Int\_t iITS=1;} turns on the ITS. Line
\texttt{0073 Int\_t iZDC=0;} turns off the ZDC\footnotemark. Note, in this
case the ZDC will not even be defined in ALIROOT. You will not be able to make
any fancy pictures of it or anything. It simply will not exist.

\addtocounter{footnote}{-1}
\footnotetext{Be car full, if a particular material was defined to have a
magnetic field this may over ride this flag. This should have been fixed, I
haven't confirmed that yet.}

\addtocounter{footnote}{1}
\footnotetext{Since the ZDC is outside of the range of produce primary
particle, in this example, there is no real use to keep it in the simulation.}

Now the following lines in the \texttt{Config.C} file, depending on the value
of the above flags, will create the specific detectors and structural
elements. Since this is an ITS manual, I will show and explain the ITS part of
this remaining file.

\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
0138
0139 if(iITS) {
0140 //=================== ITS parameters ============================
0141 //
0142 // EUCLID is a flag to output (=1) both geometry and media to two ASCII files 
0143 // (called by default ITSgeometry.euc and ITSgeometry.tme) in a format
0144 // understandable to the CAD system EUCLID. The default (=0) means that you 
0145 // dont want to use this facility.
0146 //
0147 AliITS *ITS  = new AliITSv5("ITS","normal ITS");
0148 ITS->SetEUCLID(0);
0149 }
0150 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This is the section of the \texttt{Config.C} file that defines what the ITS
is. You will note that if \texttt{iITS} = 0\footnote{A value of 0 is equivalent
to FALSE. A non-zero value is equivalent to TRUE.}, then this section of the
file will not be executed and no ITS will be defined. Line \texttt{0147}
creates the ITS. In this case it creates ITS version 5. There are two necessary
parameters. The first is the name of this detector ``ITS''. The second is a
brief description of the detector ``normal ITS''. Both of these are required so
that AliRoot knows what detector this is. AliRoot does not know about any
detectors and it is only via this detector name that we can later get access to
the information stored about the ITS. Line \texttt{0148 ITS-SetEUCLID(0);} sets
a flag for the ITS describing weather or not to create a file in the
EUCLID-GEANT3 compatible format. By default this should be 0. In the future we
may add additional flags and parameters as needed.

On line \texttt{0147 AliITS *ITS = new AliITSv5(``ITS'',''normal ITS'');} this
create an ITS of type v5. This is the detailed ITS TDR geometry. For a full
description of the possible ITS geometries see section
~\ref{ITSMan:ch2:Detaile_geometry_section}. By default, every detailed geometry
is required to have a corresponding course geometry. In this case that is
v0. All course geometries are required not to generate ``hits'' and therefore
\texttt{AliITSv0} does not and therefore can not be used in any study where
signals from the ITS may be used or required.

\section*{Other things that can be done}
